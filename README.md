# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Output from running the CLI demo (`python main.py`):

```
Today's Schedule for Alex - Monday, Jul 06
================================================

Biscuit (Golden Retriever) - Dog
  08:00  Morning walk (30 min) [priority: high] [todo]
  09:00  Feeding (10 min) [priority: high] [todo]

Mittens (Tabby) - Cat
  18:30  Litter cleanup (15 min) [priority: medium] [todo]
```

## 🧪 Testing PawPal+

```bash
# Run the full test suite:
pytest

# Run with coverage:
pytest --cov
```

Sample test output:

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

PawPal+ includes several small algorithms in `pawpal_system.py` that make the
scheduler more helpful:

| Feature | Method(s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Task sorting | `Scheduler.sort_by_time()` | Orders tasks chronologically by due time; a `sorted()` lambda pushes timeless tasks last. `generate_daily_plan()` additionally sorts by priority within a time budget. |
| Filtering | `Scheduler.filter_by_pet()`, `Scheduler.filter_by_status()` | Filter tasks by pet name (case-insensitive) or by completion status. |
| Conflict handling | `Scheduler.detect_conflicts()` | Lightweight check that flags tasks sharing the exact same start time and returns warning strings instead of raising. |
| Recurring tasks | `Task.next_occurrence()`, `Scheduler.complete_task()` | Completing a daily/weekly task auto-creates the next instance using `timedelta` (e.g., due date + 1 day). |
